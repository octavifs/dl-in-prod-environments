# Deep Learning in production: Reproducible environments recipe

This repo is a support for the articles on deep learning in production I've published on my [blog](https://octavifs.com/).

They cover different approaches to setup reproducible environments to develop deep learning projects that are suitable to deploy in production and scale among your teammates.

## Part 1
The example in *part1* covers the setup of a `conda` environment with `pytorch` and its dockerization for deployment in production.
